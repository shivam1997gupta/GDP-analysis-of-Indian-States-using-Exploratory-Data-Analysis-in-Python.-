# GDP analysis of Indian States using Exploratory Data Analysis in Python. 
You are working as the chief data scientist at NITI Aayog, reporting to the CEO. The CEO has initiated a project wherein the NITI Aayog will provide top-level recommendations to the Chief Ministers (CMs) of various states, which will help them prioritise areas of development for their respective states. Since different states are in different phases of development, the recommendations should be specific to the states.

 

The overall goal of this project is to help the CMs focus on areas that will foster economic development for their respective states. Since the most common measure of economic development is the GDP, you will analyse the GDP of the various states of India and suggest ways to improve it.
